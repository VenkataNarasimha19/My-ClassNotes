What are micro services and how they work?
micro services are system designed architecture wherel a large application is broken down into smaller and independent services. each service has it own functions and operates as a standalone entity, and these services just communicate to each other through well defined APIs or message queues. 

Using Micro services architecture, you can work on individual services without effecting the entire application making easier to deploy updates or to scale services independently.
