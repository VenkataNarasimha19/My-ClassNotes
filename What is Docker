Docker is a tool, to create, run & deploy applications in containers. a Container is a package of code, libraries and dependencies are required for an application to run. 

Docker makes it very easy to create, deploy and run applications in the form of containers. Using Docker Containers, you can run your applications on-premises, local-hosts, on cloud and any where you want.

this means, using docker, the application will run the same way, no matter where it is deployed. so the problem of it runs on my machine is solved.
